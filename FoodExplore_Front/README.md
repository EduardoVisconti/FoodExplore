## Project Description

Food Explorer is a digital menu for a fictional restaurant. Developed end-to-end with front-end and back-end, the project simulates a complete restaurant based on the layout provided in Figma, which includes the visualization of dishes, details, and even the payment process.

The system is divided into two personas: the admin and the user. The admin, responsible for the restaurant, has access to functionalities for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting dishes. Each dish includes an image, name, category, description, ingredients, and price. The admin receives a success message when adding a new dish.

The user has access to view all registered dishes, and when clicking on a dish, they are redirected to a new screen with detailed information about the dish.
